            2. I agree to attend the safety orientation at the beginning of the Session and will not operate any equipment or use any materials without first familiarizing myself without their safe use. I agree that under no circumstances will I operate or use any tools, equipment, machinery or any other materials or substances at the Facility which have not been expressly mentioned during the safety orientation as being included and associated with participation in the Session. If I believe anything to be unsafe, I will immediately notify a member of the Girls Guild staff.

            3.

            4. I will exercise the highest degree of care in my use of all tools, equipment, machinery, and other materials and/or substances to avoid damages to all equipment used during my participation in the Session and to avoid damage to the Facility and all fixtures and contents therein. I agree to indemnify and reimburse Girls Guild and/or the owner of the Facility, as applicable, for all damage that I cause to any equipment, infrastructure or any other improvements and facilities.

            6. I understand that I may be asked to leave the Session for violating any provision of this Agreement or for any other reason within the sole discretion of the Girls Guild staff, and upon such request, I will immediately vacate the Facility.
