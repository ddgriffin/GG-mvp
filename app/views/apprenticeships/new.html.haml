          %li
            %b Hours:
            We suggest you schedule an average of 8-16 hours/week to get your apprentice up to speed quickly. It's best if you decide on a consistent schedule at the start, and stick to it.
          %br
          %li
            %b Timeframe:
            In-house apprenticeships are typically 3 months in length. We suggest you divide the timeframe up into 4 equal parts. You'll spend the first part teaching, the second part practicing, and the last two parts instructing when needed while working together.
          %br
          %li
            %b Payment:
            We ask for a connection fee from both Maker and Apprentice. This fee covers our services and support. These are also typically paid apprenticeships whereby the Apprentice is brought on and paid by the business no less than minimum-wage.
          %br
          %li
            %b Instruction:
            We ask that you work in the same location for at least 50% of the time you've scheduled for the apprenticeship in order to allow for questions and feedback to happen naturally.
          %br
          %li
            %b Skills:
            You should be teaching the skills and tools that are required for the kind of work that you need help with. It's ok to require some pre-existing skills related to the work - but count on teaching your apprentice the main skills.
          %br
          %li
            %b Feedback:
            You'll need to give feedback on how the apprentice is doing as she learns, allowing her to ask questions, make mistakes and practice. We will schedule a mid-way check in to chat about goals and progress.
