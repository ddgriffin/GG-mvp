          %li
            %b Hours:
            We suggest you schedule an average of 16 hours/week to get your apprentice up to speed quickly. It's best if you decide on a consistent schedule at the start, and stick to it.
          %br
          %li
            %b Timeframe:
            We suggest you divide the timeframe up into 4 equal parts. You'll spend the first part teaching, the second part practicing, and the last two parts instructing when needed while working together.
          %br
          %li
            %b Instruction:
            We ask that you work in the same location for at least 50% of the time you've scheduled for the apprenticeship in order to allow for questions and feedback to happen naturally.
          %br
          %li
            %b Skills:
            You should be teaching the skills and tools that are required for the kind of work that you need help with. It's ok to require some pre-existing skills related to the work - but count on teaching the main skills.
          %br
          %li
            %b Feedback:
            You'll need to give feedback on how the apprentice is doing as she learns, allowing her to ask questions, make mistakes and practice. We're happy to help facilitate a mid-way check in to chat about goals and progress.
