//Hours:%0AWe suggest you schedule an average of 8-16 hours per week to get your apprentice up to speed quickly. It's best if you decide on a consistent schedule at the start, and stick to it.%0A%0ATimeframe:%0AIn-house apprenticeships are typically 3 months in length. We suggest you divide the timeframe up into 4 equal parts. You'll spend the first part teaching, the second part practicing, and the last two parts instructing when needed while working together.%0A%0APayment:%0AWe ask for a beta connection fee of $75.00 from the Maker. This fee covers our services and support. These are also typically paid apprenticeships whereby the Apprentice is brought on and paid by the business no less than minimum-wage. These details are the responsibility of the Maker's business to address.%0A%0AInstruction:%0AWe ask that you work in the same location for at least 50 percent of the time you've scheduled for the apprenticeship in order to allow for questions and feedback to happen naturally.%0A%0ASkills:%0AYou should be teaching the skills and tools that are required for the kind of work that you need help with. It's ok to require some pre-existing skills related to the work, but count on teaching your apprentice the main skills.%0A%0AFeedback:%0AYou'll give feedback on how the apprentice is doing as she learns, allowing her to ask questions, make mistakes and practice. We will schedule a mid-way check in to chat about goals and progress.%0A%0A%0A
