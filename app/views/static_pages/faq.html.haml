                  %p GirlsGuild is a service that offers apprenticeships for girls, by girls. We connect girls and women with artists and makers to build a supportive, collaborative community.
                  %p We define apprenticeship as more hands-on than a “mentorship”, and more supportive than an “internship”. In an apprenticeship, a maker works one-on-one with a girl interested in learning the skills of her art. It's about getting real world experience of a maker's work and lifestyle, and building some serious skills in a particular area of making.

                  %p If you have a skill you’d like to share, or could use some help with your work, consider posting an apprenticeship. You can teach a particular technique or tool in a Workshop (aka a 1-day Apprenticeship), or share your practice in a Production, Event, or Ongoing Apprenticeships.
                  %p If you're interested in picking up some new skills and meeting new friends while you're at it, you can try a workshop (1-day apprenticeship) to get your feet wet and learn a new technique. And if you're really looking to build your skills and get some real experience working with an artist longer term, apply for a production, event, or ongoing apprenticeship.

Makers have the option to specify that their workshop or apprenticeship be opened to all gender identities.

                    When a maker posts an apprenticeship or workshop, we use their first and last name to search both criminal offenses as well as sexual offenses. If we find a match for any of these serious crimes we won't post the apprenticeship or workshop for this reason. Makers, be assured there will be no point in the process that we share any information we may find on PublicData.com with anyone, nor will this process affect your public records in any way.

Being a maker can be a lonely venture!  We believe sharing your skills and techniques is both smart for your business as well as your heart. Get help making while you share your skills and benefit from working alongside other makers. They’ll give you a fresh perspective and force you to put your process into words. If you’re still not sure, we’d be happy to chat with you about what types of skills you could share.

                  %p We've tried to keep our framework for apprenticeships broad, so you can offer an apprenticeship that will truly meet your needs. However, we've found that most apprenticeships fall into three main categories; Production, Event, and Ongoing.
                  %h4 Production Apprenticeship
                  %p If you need help producing a big order or a new line of your work, you might consider taking on a girl to help you as a production apprentice.
                  %h4 Event Apprenticeship
                  %p If you have an upcoming event you could use a hand with, consider an apprentice to help plan, prepare for, and carry it out.
                  %h4 Ongoing Apprenticeship
                  %p Or if you're simply interested in new collaborations and the chance to teach your skills and share your process, an ongoing apprenticeship carries a lot of possibilities.
                  %h4 Workshop (1-Day Apprenticeship)
                  %p
                    Workshops, (what we call "1-Day Apprenticeships") are typically for a group of apprentices, where the focus is on either demonstrating a process or technique, or actually working on making a project either collaboratively or independently.

                  %p Once you know what you'd like in an apprentice, you can let us know by proposing an apprenticeship for us to list on our website. We'll collect applications from interested girls for you to review, and you choose the applicant that seems best suited to work with you.

                  In most cases, the give and take of teaching and working will likely balance out; you teach your process and skills in return for her assistance with your work. However, you should consider whether the level of work and the time commitment you expect from your apprentice should be paid, or whether you'll be taking on a level of teaching that merits payment. If you do plan to pay, or ask for payment, you should explain that in the description of your apprenticeship when you propose it. In that case payment would be a matter between you and the apprentice, and would not be managed by GirlsGuild.

                  It's up to you, based on your needs. Some apprenticeships might be as short as a few weeks, but we think the most rewarding will be for a longer period of a few months. That way you'll have time to teach your apprentice the skills and techniques she needs, and see her progress in the work she's doing with you. You can meet as often as works for both your schedules; 5-15 hours a week is typical. We limit the length of all apprenticeships to 6 months.

                  We require that all apprentices agree to a participation waiver (and for minors, their parents sign an indemnification agreement) before accepting an apprenticeship or signing up for a workshop, in order to protect you if something were to happen. We will also send you a link to download a copy of those waivers to have your participants sign in person and for you to keep on file. We encourage you to contact us at any time; we’ll do our best to address any questions or issues that arise.

                  Some makers produce work that is uniquely their own artistic style, and we recognize that copying can sometimes feel like it's not the best form of flattery. That's why we've included a clause in the participation waiver so that apprentices agree not to replicate the individual artistic styles of our amazing artists, although they should feel free to use the techniques they learn to develop their own style.

                  %p When you apply for an apprenticeship we'll ask for your billing information, but we won't charge you unless you're accepted to be an apprentice. The maker reviews all the applications she receives, and chooses the girl who'll be the best fit for the work they'll be doing. Makers sometimes ask to meet up to get a feel for personality before making a decision, so if that’s the case we'll get in touch to set it up. We'll let you know her decision within two weeks, and if you're accepted, we'll put you in touch to get started. You'll have 7 days to cancel if you decide it's not a good fit, before we charge you both the $30 matching fee.
                  %p Each apprenticeship that’s posted typically gets 3-10 applications, so don’t be discouraged if someone else is chosen for the apprenticeship you applied for! We’re always working on getting more makers offering new opportunities, and in the meantime, consider building up your skills through workshops (1-day apprenticeships).

                  Sometimes if the apprenticeship is a longer or more intensive time commitment it will take longer to fill the apprenticeship. The sweet spot seems to be a 3-month apprenticeship from 5-15 hours per week, which seem to fill in a day or two, but there are so many factors that go into it, that it’s hard to tell. Feel free to email us if you’d like suggestions on how to fill it quickly.

                  Absolutely - we recommend it! What we'll do is forward you the applications as we receive them and when you see someone you'd like to interview just follow the link to their application and click "Request an Interview". She'll choose a time and date that works for her, and you're all set to meet up. We'll even send you both an interview worksheet for help covering all the right topics.

We’ll also suggest makers in the community that can help you reach your goals. It’s all about who you know, so we’ll help you build skills and social connections with maker-mentors who can help guide your career toward awesomeness. You can get started by following makers who inspire you to get first dibs on opportunities to work with them before we release to the rest of the Guild.

You’ll be able to upload pictures of the work you’ve made, add titles and text, and share on your social networks. These portfolios will serve to help you get more opportunities to work with other makers, as well maybe even apply for school or for jobs!  We’ll let you opt in to publicly display your portfolio once we’ve built it!

                .accordion-inner
                  In a workshop (what we call a 1-day Apprenticeship), an artist or maker offers to teach a particular project or technique to one or more girls, usually in a 2-4 hour session. It's a chance to learn from the maker, to gain a new skill, to try your hand at a new process, or see how it's done.

                .accordion-inner
                  %p We believe that the maker is the best person to determine the cost of their workshop based on materials, length of the session, and effort. That's why we leave the cost up to you. Sometimes that means it will be too high and you will get fewer registrants, or if it's too low, you may feel like it wasn't quite worth the effort. So to give you some basic guidelines, when we spoke to parents they were comfortable paying between $40-60 for a 2-3 hour workshop. The cost of materials should be included in the cost you set for your workshop. Sometimes the materials can be expensive, so let that show by listing the materials in the class description! Generally, it's up to the maker to source and provide materials (depending on what you plan to teach).
                  %p We want to make GirlsGuild a viable way to make supplementary income, so we encourage you not to sell yourself short. Even if you'd be happy to teach a workshop for free, we've found that putting a small cost ($5-10 or so) actually gets better attendance - people see it as more valuable, and more of a commitment, when they've paid for it.

                  You can choose to receive payments for workshops either by Paypal or by Check. We'll ask you to choose an option and provide details as part of the process for posting your workshop, so there won't be any delays getting your payment to you after the workshop.

                  Each workshop is different, so costs vary. When a maker offers to lead a workshop, she sets the cost to include the materials and tools that will be used, and to fit the length of the workshop. For most workshops, the sign-up fee covers all the materials you’ll use to make something you’ll bring home with you.

                  That's fine. We offer students a full refund if they let us know 7 days before the workshop. We do this so that the maker knows a full week before the event to prepare for the full number of students, and doesn't get stuck with extra materials she's purchased.
